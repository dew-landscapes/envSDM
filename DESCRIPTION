Authors@R:
    c(
    person(given = "Stuart",
           family = "Brown",
           role = c("aut"),
           email = "stuart.brown@sa.gov.au"),

Description: The goal of envSDM is to help automate the creation, validation,
    and prediction of species distribution models (SDMs). For each taxa the
    preparation, tuning, selection of best model and prediction are covered.
